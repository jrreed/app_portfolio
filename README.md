This is my Project-0 app I submitted for Udacity's Android Nanodegree program. This app serves as a portolio and launcher for all future applications developed in the program. 

I started by building out the app to match the Udacity look and feel. I then went back through and refactored the application to pull out common styles, strings, colors, etc. and move them into their respective XML resource files. I think I enjoyed that part the most. It reminded a lot of doing web development where the markup and the styles kept in separate css and html files.
